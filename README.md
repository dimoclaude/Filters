# Filters
This project coded in PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, and JQuery might allow one to understand how to filter and show data. By way of illustration, we have considered the case of a mini bookshop. The idea is to filter sales by customer, product, and price, and then display the results in a table just below the filter.

The project is made of seven folders, namely:
  - The folder named Build: Here, you will find the CSS folder and the JS folder.
  - The folder named Database: In this folder, you will the SQL database file and the database scheme given in a PNG file
  - The folder named Img in which there are two free images I used for the index page.
  - The folder named Inclusions contains some files that are included in the code
  - The folder named Model where you will find the main filter named filter.php including the other different filters. In the sale folder, you will also see a JSON file named sales.json
  - The folder named Public contains the index of the filter page that includes the file named page_vew.php
  - The folder named vendor in which you will see the bootstrap, font-awesome, and the JQuery libraries I have used in the project.

Hope this will be useful for you. -:)
